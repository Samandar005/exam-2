                    <span>Author: {{ article.author }}</span>

                <h2>{{ article.title }}</h2>
                <p>{{ article.short_content }}</p>

                <div class="terminal">
                    curl -X POST -F "file=@malicious.php" http://vulnerable-site.com/upload.php
                </div>

                <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the vulnerable code:</p>
                <pre><code>
&lt;?php
if ($_FILES['file']['type'] === 'image/jpeg') {
    $uploaddir = '/var/www/uploads/';
    $uploadfile = $uploaddir . basename($_FILES['file']['name']);
    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile);
    echo "File is valid, and was successfully uploaded.";
} else {
    echo "File is not a valid JPEG.";
}
?&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <p>The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the file type, which relies solely on the MIME type provided by the client.</p>

                <h2>Impact and Mitigation</h2>
                <p>The impact of this vulnerability is severe, as it could lead to complete server takeover. To mitigate the risk:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Update your CMS to the latest version immediately</li>
                    <li>Implement strong file validation, including content inspection</li>
                    <li>Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to filter malicious requests</li>
                    <li>Regularly audit your systems for unauthorized changes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Remember, responsible disclosure is crucial in the world of cybersecurity. If you discover a vulnerability, always report it to the vendor before making it public.</p>
